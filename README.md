## Content

- Introduction: general purpose computing systems. Microprocessors.
– Information representation and basic operations
  - Representation of information: the bit as a unit of information. Integer data types – positive integers and signed integers; representations in sign and modulus, one's complement and two's complement: range of representation. Decimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal conversion. Hexadecimal notation.
  - Binary Arithmetic: addition and subtraction.
  - Logical operations: AND, OR, NOT, Exclusive OR.
  - Representation of non-numeric information. The ASCII code.
  - Floating point representation. Brief reference to the IEEE 754 Standard for floating point representation.
– Logic Circuits
  - Logic gates: NOT, OR, NOR, AND, NAND.
  - Basic combinatorial blocks: decoders, multiplexers, full-adder.
  - Basic information storage devices: R-S latch, Flip-Flop D. Registers.
  - Memory: address space. Addressing memory cells. Memory technologies: SRAM and DRAM.IV – The Von Neumann Model.
  - The basic components: Memory, Processing Unit, Data Input and Output, Control Unit.
  - Structure of a MIPS processor. Basic instruction processing cycle.
  - Organization of the central memory of computing systems. Basic memory access cycles.
  - General traces of the evolution of computing systems architecture and implementation technologies.
  - The different levels of use of computing systems: application, high-level programming language, Assembly, operation system services.
  - Function and structure. Architecture as the common basic functional view of a "family" of processors. Programming model and instruction repertoire.
– The MIPS architecture
  - Programming model. Instruction repertoire: the 3 main classes of instructions - processing (arithmetic and logical), information transfer and execution flow control.
  - Arithmetic and logical instructions in the MIPS architecture. Instruction codes.
  - Memory access instructions and addressing modes.
  - Translation of if and if…else decision structures to assembly: conditional and unconditional jump instructions.
  - Translation of flow control structures: for, while and do...while. Sequential access to array elements.
  - Procedures: invocation and return. The problem of passing parameters. Stack usage.
  - Conventions for safeguarding the content of records.
– The assembler and the “assembling” process
  - Assembly language.
    - Instrutions
    - Directives
    - Examples
  - The process of translating assembly programs into executable binary.
– Communication with the outside world: data input and output
  - Memory-mapped vs. memory-mapped inputs and outputs specific instructions for data input and output.
  - Inputs/Outputs under interruption. The interrupt system. Programming under interruption.
